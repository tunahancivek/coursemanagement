To align with the request for comprehensive documentation for the Course Enrollment and Grade Management System project in Java, below are detailed instructions, explanations, and guidelines covering the project's classes, methods, variables, and their usage. This documentation aims to ensure clarity and facilitate ease of understanding and maintenance.
Overview
The Course Enrollment and Grade Management System is designed to manage the enrollment of students in courses, assign grades to them, and handle other related functionalities. The system comprises several classes, each responsible for handling specific aspects of the system:
Student: Manages student information and their course enrollments and grades.
Course: Represents course details and tracks total enrollment.
CourseManagement: Serves as the central control for adding courses, enrolling students, assigning grades, and potentially calculating overall grades.
Classes and Their Responsibilities
Student Class
• Variables:
• name: Private instance variable to store the student's name.
• ID: Private instance variable to store the student's ID.
• enrolledCourses: Private instance variable, a map that associates
courses (as keys) with grades (as values).
• Methods:
• Constructor: Initializes a new student with an ID and name.
• getName, setName: Getters and setters for the student's name.
• getID, setID: Getters and setters for the student's ID.
• enrollInCourse: Adds a course to the student's list of enrolled courses without a grade.
• assignGrade: Assigns or updates a grade for a specific course. Course Class
• Variables:
• courseCode, name, maxCapacity: Private instance variables to store the course's code, name, and maximum capacity, respectively.
• totalEnrolled: A private static variable to track the total number of students enrolled across all courses.
• Methods:
• Constructor: Initializes a new course with a code, name, and maximum capacity.
• getCourseCode, getName, getMaxCapacity: Getter methods for the course's code, name, and maximum capacity.
• getTotalEnrolled: Static method to get the total number of enrolled students.
• enrollStudent: Static method to increment the count of total enrolled students.
CourseManagement Class
• Variables:
• courses: A static list to store all courses available in the system.
• students: A static map to store all students, keyed by their ID.
• Methods:
• addCourse: Adds a new course to the system.
• getOrCreateStudent: Retrieves an existing student by ID or creates a new one if not found.
• getCourseByCode: Finds and returns a course by its code.
• enrollStudent: Enrolls a student in a specific course.
• assignGrade: Assigns a grade to a student for a specific course.
• Additional methods for functionalities such as calculating overall
grades can be implemented as needed.
Usage Instructions
Adding a Course: Invoke
CourseManagement.addCourse(new Course("CS101", "Intro to CS", 30)); to add a new course.
Enrolling a Student: To enroll a student, first ensure the student exists or create a new one using getOrCreateStudent, then use
enrollStudent to enroll them in a course.
Assigning Grades: Use assignGrade with a student,
course, and grade to assign or update a student's grade for a course.
